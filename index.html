    <p id="hd3">The first trek I went to was Triund in Himachal Pradesh. As soon as I reached the peak after my 6 hours trek, I was mermesied by its beauty and silence. I felt the clouds pass through me and snow cladded mountains all around me. It felt like heaven where Gods resided. Peace and tranqulity replaced all worries, pain and questions. absolute beauty and untouched by sorrow.
    
    <br><br>We were welcomed by hot dal, rice and chicken curry made by our sherpa. I retired to a corner and watched the mighty mountains. As the day ended, the weather dropped to 10C yet I wanted to enjoy each moment outside the tent. For the first time, I saw sky full of stars. It illuminated the peak.. I lit a cigarette and thought to myself, I will definitely return.
        
    <br><br>Since then, I complete one trek every 6 months and one day I want to conquer the Everest.
